            <p class="intro">This website is very cool! It has all kinds of different <span class="intro-specials-font">fonts</span> and also different <span class="intro-specials-deco">decorations!</span></p>
            <p class="intro2">This line has a border around it! Thats pretty cool. We can do all kinds of cool things in HTML and CSS. Lets have a look at some of the cool things we can do.</p>
            <p class="html-basic">We've already looked at changing fonts and using text decorations, but there is a lot more than that. At the top of the page there is a header. This header will stay at the top when you scroll down. That's pretty cool right? The text on the header are also links to other pages. Try it! Thats pretty amazing, and I accomplished it using only basic HTML and css. <br>Some other cool things we can do are making <span class="color-c">c</span><span class="color-o">o</span><span class="color-l">l</span><span class="color-o2">o</span><span class="color-r">r</span><span class="color-f">f</span><span class="color-u">u</span><span class="color-l2">l</span> text</span></p>
